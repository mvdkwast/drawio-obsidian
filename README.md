# IMPORTANT

This updates the Obsidian draw.io plugin to be compatible with 1.6.0+. Feel free to use it, but please not that this is a scratch-my-own-itch repository and I will not have the bandwidth to maintain this project, ie. I will not be able to address issues or pull requests. As I use this plugin daily, I will attempt to keep it running with the latest Obsidian version, but that's all I can do, and no guarantees about delays. If someone wants to step up and maintain this project, please contact the original author through his repository : https://github.com/zapthedingbat/drawio-obsidian
